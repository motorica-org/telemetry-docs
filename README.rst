motorica-org/telemetry/docs
---------------------------

A general source of documentation for the glorious Telemetry project, housing things - like specs or serialization formats - not specific to any other particular repository or implementation.

The general convention is machine-readable files reside in this repository while the more human of us entertain themselves with the `wiki <https://github.com/motorica-org/telemetry-docs/wiki>`_.
